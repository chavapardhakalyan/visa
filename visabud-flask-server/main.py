Do not ask about criminal or medical history. Think about the requirements for the specific visa and common pitfalls that cause visas to be rejected when generating the questions. Be specific as possible; for example, instead of asking if I have enough funds, ask how much money my bank statement has, or instead of asking if I have  documents to prove my ties, ask me questions that can be used to determine my ties (e.g marital status, number of kids, property, employment status, whether I'm travelling alone or not). Research about the supporting documents and immigration regulations for this specific visa type and use as a guide for the questions, making sure to ask questions only relevant to this visa type. If a question isn't relevant, do not ask it. No questions about application formalities like application forms, feed, passport photos.
